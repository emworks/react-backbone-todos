# React TodoMVC Example With Backbone Integration

* Add a task with title
* List tasks in sorted in reverse order by task title
* Edit a task
* Mark a task as completed
* Remove a task
* Persist tasks between working sessions (it could be LocalStorage)

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and visit http://localhost/.../myexample/.
